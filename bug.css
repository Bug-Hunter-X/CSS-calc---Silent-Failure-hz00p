The CSS property `calc()` is used to perform calculations within CSS. However, if there is a missing operator or incorrect syntax, the calculation will fail silently.  This can be hard to debug because it won't throw an error in the browser's developer console, instead it will just not work as expected. For example, a missing multiplication operator: `width: calc(200px 2);` will be parsed incorrectly,  resulting in an unexpected width.
