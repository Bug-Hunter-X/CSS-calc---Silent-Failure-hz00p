The solution is to ensure the correct syntax is used in `calc()`.  Always include the necessary operators (+, -, *, /) between values.  For example, to calculate a width that is 2 times 200px, it should be `width: calc(200px * 2);`.

```css
/* bugSolution.css */
#element {
  width: calc(200px * 2);
  height: 100px;
}
```
